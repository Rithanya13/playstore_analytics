## 📄 Project Summary
A predictive analytics project analyzing factors that drive app downloads, user ratings, and pricing strategies on the Google Play Store.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Train and evaluate predictive models for installs and ratings  
- Simulate price optimization for revenue maximization  
- Communicate results through visualizations and written insights  
- Reflect on ethical implications and model interpretability  

## ❓ Business Questions
1. **Download‑Volume Drivers**  
   _Which app attributes most influence install counts?_  
2. **Rating Prediction**  
   _Can we predict an app’s average user rating from its features?_  
3. **Price Optimization**  
   _What price maximizes total predicted revenue, accounting for price sensitivity?_
